  "Code execution in the Convex Virtual Machine

   Altering its state and gaining insights.

   The central entity of this namespace is the execution context created by [[ctx]]. They embed a [[state]] and allow
   executing code to alter it.

   All other functions revolve around contextes. While the design of a context is mostly immutable, whenever an altering function
   is applied (eg. [[juice-set]]) or code is handled in any way (eg. [[eval]]), the old context must be discarded and only the
   returned one should be used.

   Cheap copies can be created using [[fork]].

   Actions involving code (eg. [[compile]], [[exec]], ...) return a new context which holds either a [[result]] or an [[exception]].
   Those actions always consume [[juice]].

   Given that a \"cell\" is the term reserved for CVM data and objects, execution consists of the following steps:

   | Step | Function    | Does                                                |
   |------|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
   | 1    | [[expand]]  | `cell` -> `canonical cell`, applies macros          |
   | 2    | [[compile]] | `canonical cell` -> `op`, preparing executable code |
   | 3    | [[exec]]    | Executes compiled code                              |

   Any cell can be applied safely to those functions, worse that can happen is nothing (e.g. providing an already compiled cell to
   [[compile]]).

   If fine-grained control is not needed and if source is not compiled anyways, a simpler alternative is to use [[eval]] which does
   all the job."
