(ns convex.client

  "Interacting with a peer server via the binary protocol.

   After creating a client with [[connect]], main interactions are [[query]] and [[transact]].

   All IO functions return a future which ultimately resolves to a result received from the peer.
   Information from result can be extracted using:

   - [[error-code]]
   - [[trace]]
   - [[value]]"

   Transaction must be either pre-signed or a key pair must be provided (see `convex.sign` namespace from
